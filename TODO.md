**Service Management Architecture**

This document describes the service management system in `sitectl`, which allows users to customize their ISLE installations by enabling or disabling docker-compose services.

## Overview

The service management system provides a flexible way to:

1. **Disable services during initial installation** via `create context` command
2. **Manage services on existing installations** via standalone `service` commands
3. **Work seamlessly with both local and remote contexts**

This is particularly useful for:
- Reducing resource usage by disabling optional services (e.g., blazegraph, solr)
- Customizing ISLE installations for specific use cases
- Testing different configurations

## Architecture Components

### 1. Docker Compose Manipulation Package (`pkg/compose`)

**Location**: `pkg/compose/compose.go`

The core of the service management system is a package that handles reading, parsing, and modifying `docker-compose.yml` files. It provides context-aware operations that work for both local and remote installations.

**Key Components**:

- **`ServiceManager`**: Main struct that wraps a `config.Context` and provides service management operations
- **`ComposeFile`**: Struct representing the docker-compose.yaml structure (services, networks, volumes, secrets)

**Key Methods**:

```go
// Create a new service manager for a context
func NewServiceManager(ctx *config.Context) *ServiceManager

// Read and parse docker-compose.yml (local or remote)
func (sm *ServiceManager) ReadComposeFile() (*ComposeFile, error)

// Write modified compose file back (local or remote via SFTP)
func (sm *ServiceManager) WriteComposeFile(compose *ComposeFile) error

// List all services in the compose file
func (sm *ServiceManager) ListServices() ([]string, error)

// Check if a service exists
func (sm *ServiceManager) ServiceExists(serviceName string) (bool, error)

// Remove a service from docker-compose.yml
func (sm *ServiceManager) DisableService(serviceName string) error

// Get detailed information about a service
func (sm *ServiceManager) GetServiceInfo(serviceName string) (map[string]interface{}, error)
```

**Design Principles**:

1. **Context Abstraction**: All file operations use the existing `config.Context` abstraction:
   - For local contexts: Direct filesystem operations
   - For remote contexts: SSH/SFTP operations via context methods

2. **Safe YAML Manipulation**: Uses `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` for proper YAML parsing and serialization

3. **Orphaned Resource Cleanup**: When disabling a service, the system automatically removes:
   - Volumes that were only used by that service
   - (Future: networks, secrets that are no longer referenced)

4. **Drupal Configuration Hooks**: Services can define hooks to clean up Drupal configuration when disabled:
   - Removes config files from `config/sync` directory
   - Runs `drush config:import` to apply changes
   - Works for both local and remote contexts

### 2. Standalone Service Command (`cmd/service.go`)

**Location**: `cmd/service.go`

Provides a CLI interface for managing services on existing installations.

**Subcommands**:

```bash
# List all services
sitectl service list

# Disable one or more services
sitectl service disable blazegraph
sitectl service disable blazegraph solr --yes

# Get information about a service
sitectl service info blazegraph

# Enable a service (not yet implemented)
sitectl service enable blazegraph
```

**Command Structure**:

- `service` - Root command for service management
  - `list` - List all services in docker-compose.yml
  - `disable [service-name...]` - Disable services (with confirmation)
  - `enable [service-name]` - Re-enable services (planned)
  - `info [service-name]` - Show service details

**Flags**:

- `--context, -c`: Specify which context to operate on
- `--yes`: Skip confirmation prompts (useful for automation/scripts)

**Safety Features**:

1. **Confirmation Prompts**: By default, shows what will be changed and asks for confirmation
2. **Validation**: Checks that services exist before attempting to disable them
3. **Clear Messaging**: Shows the path being modified and services being affected

### 3. Integration with Create Context Command

**Location**: `cmd/create.go` and `pkg/isle/buildkit.go`

Service management is integrated into the `create context` workflow, allowing users to customize installations during initial setup.

**New Flag**:

```bash
--disable-service=SERVICE_NAME
```

This flag can be repeated to disable multiple services:

```bash
sitectl create context mysite \
  --disable-service=blazegraph \
  --disable-service=solr \
  --yes
```

**Workflow**:

1. User runs `create context` with optional `--disable-service` flags
2. The setup script downloads and installs ISLE site template as normal
3. **After installation completes**, the system:
   - Reads the installed docker-compose.yml
   - Removes specified services
   - Cleans up orphaned volumes
   - Writes the modified compose file back

4. Context is saved to config

**User Experience**:

- **With `--yes` flag**: Services are automatically disabled, no prompts
- **Without `--yes` flag**: Shows all settings including services to be disabled, asks for confirmation
- **Interactive mode**: User is prompted for all settings, sees services that will be disabled before confirming

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create New Site Without Blazegraph

```bash
# Using flags (no prompts)
sitectl create context mysite \
  --type local \
  --profile dev \
  --project-dir /home/user/mysite \
  --disable-service=blazegraph \
  --yes

# Interactive mode (prompted for each setting)
sitectl create context mysite
# Is the context local or remote? [local]: local
# Where would you like to install the project? [/home/user/mysite]:
#
# Optional services:
#   Include blazegraph? (RDF triplestore for Linked Data and SPARQL queries) [Y/n]: n
#
# Here is the context that will be created
# ... (shows context details) ...
#
# Services to be disabled after installation:
#   - blazegraph
#
# Are you sure you want to proceed creating the site? y/N: y
```

**Behavior**:
- If no `--disable-service` flags are provided and `--yes` is not used, the tool asks about each optional service
- Each service shows its description to help users decide
- Default responses are indicated (Y/n means Yes is default, y/N means No is default)
- Pressing Enter accepts the default
- If `--disable-service` flags ARE provided, no prompts are shown (explicit flags take precedence)

### Example 2: Disable Service on Existing Installation

```bash
# On current context
sitectl service disable blazegraph

# Output:
# You are about to disable the following service(s):
#   - blazegraph
#     → Will remove 8 Drupal config file(s)
#
# This will modify:
#   - /path/to/site/docker-compose.yml
#   - config/sync/ (Drupal configuration)
#
# Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]: y
#
# Cleaning up Drupal configuration for 'blazegraph'...
#   ✓ Removed search_api.server.blazegraph.yml
#   ✓ Removed context.context.blazegraph_index.yml
#   ✓ Removed system.action.index_node_in_blazegraph.yml
#   ... (more config files)
#
# Importing configuration changes...
#   ✓ Configuration imported successfully
# ✓ Service 'blazegraph' disabled
#
# Services successfully disabled!
# Run 'sitectl compose down && sitectl compose up' to apply changes.

# On specific context
sitectl service disable blazegraph --context prod

# Multiple services, skip confirmation
sitectl service disable blazegraph solr --yes

# Then apply the changes
sitectl compose down
sitectl compose up
```

### Example 3: List and Inspect Services

```bash
# List all services
sitectl service list

# Get details about a specific service
sitectl service info blazegraph
```

### Example 4: Remote Context

All commands work identically for remote contexts:

```bash
# Create remote site without optional services
sitectl create context prod \
  --type remote \
  --ssh-hostname docker.example.com \
  --ssh-user deploy \
  --project-dir /opt/isle \
  --disable-service=blazegraph \
  --disable-service=solr \
  --yes

# Manage services on remote installation
sitectl service list --context prod
sitectl service disable fedora --context prod --yes
```

## Implementation Details

### File Operations Across Local and Remote Contexts

The `ServiceManager` abstracts file operations to work with both local and remote contexts:

**Local Context**:
```go
// Read
data, err := os.ReadFile(composePath)

// Write
err := os.WriteFile(composePath, data, 0644)
```

**Remote Context**:
```go
// Read
fileContent := sm.context.ReadSmallFile(composePath)

// Write (via temp file + SFTP)
tmpFile, _ := os.CreateTemp("", "docker-compose-*.yml")
tmpFile.Write(data)
sm.context.UploadFile(tmpFile.Name(), composePath)
```

### YAML Parsing and Manipulation

The system uses `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` for YAML operations:

```go
type ComposeFile struct {
    Version  string                 `yaml:"version,omitempty"`
    Services map[string]interface{} `yaml:"services,omitempty"`
    Networks map[string]interface{} `yaml:"networks,omitempty"`
    Volumes  map[string]interface{} `yaml:"volumes,omitempty"`
    Secrets  map[string]interface{} `yaml:"secrets,omitempty"`
}

// Parse
yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(fileContent), &compose)

// Modify
delete(compose.Services, serviceName)

// Serialize
yaml.Marshal(compose)
```

### Orphaned Volume Cleanup

When a service is disabled, volumes that are no longer referenced by any service are automatically removed:

```go
func cleanupOrphanedVolumes(compose *ComposeFile, removedService string) {
    // Build set of volumes still in use by remaining services
    volumesInUse := make(map[string]bool)
    for _, svc := range compose.Services {
        // Parse volume definitions: "volume-name:/path"
        // Add to volumesInUse set
    }

    // Remove unused volumes
    for volumeName := range compose.Volumes {
        if !volumesInUse[volumeName] {
            delete(compose.Volumes, volumeName)
        }
    }
}
```

### Drupal Configuration Hooks

**Location**: `pkg/compose/hooks.go`

Services can define hooks that specify Drupal configuration files to remove when the service is disabled. This ensures that Drupal configuration stays in sync with the available services.

**Hook Registry**:

```go
var ServiceHookRegistry = map[string]*ServiceHook{
    "blazegraph": {
        ServiceName: "blazegraph",
        Description: "RDF triplestore for Linked Data and SPARQL queries",
        ConfigFilesToRemove: []string{
            "search_api.server.blazegraph.yml",
            "context.context.blazegraph_index.yml",
            "system.action.index_node_in_blazegraph.yml",
            "system.action.index_media_in_blazegraph.yml",
            "system.action.index_file_in_blazegraph.yml",
            "system.action.delete_node_from_blazegraph.yml",
            "system.action.delete_media_from_blazegraph.yml",
            "system.action.delete_file_from_blazegraph.yml",
        },
    },
}
```

**Hook Execution Flow**:

1. **Check for hook**: When disabling a service, check if a hook is defined
2. **Remove config files**: Delete specified files from `config/sync/` directory
3. **Import configuration**: Run `drush config:import -y` via docker compose exec
4. **Remove service**: Continue with docker-compose.yml modification

This happens **before** the service is removed from docker-compose.yml, ensuring the drupal container is still running and can execute drush commands.

**Adding New Service Hooks**:

To add a hook for a new service, add an entry to `ServiceHookRegistry` in `pkg/compose/hooks.go`:

```go
"fedora": {
    ServiceName:     "fedora",
    Description:     "Fedora repository for digital object storage",
    IsOptional:      true,       // Will be offered during interactive install
    DefaultEnabled:  true,        // Default answer when prompted
    ConfigFilesToRemove: []string{
        "islandora.settings.yml",  // May contain Fedora URL
        "flysystem.settings.yml",  // Fedora flysystem configuration
        // Add other related config files
    },
},
```

**Service Hook Fields**:
- `ServiceName`: Docker compose service name
- `Description`: Human-readable description shown during prompts
- `IsOptional`: If true, users will be asked about this service during interactive installation
- `DefaultEnabled`: Default answer for optional services (Y/n vs y/N)
- `ConfigFilesToRemove`: Drupal config files to remove when disabling

The config file names should match the filenames in the `config/sync/` directory of islandora-starter-site.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Service Templates for Re-enabling

Currently, `service enable` is not implemented because it requires storing the original service definitions. Potential solutions:

- **Version control**: Encourage users to commit docker-compose.yml before modifications
- **Backup files**: Automatically create `.bak` files before modifications
- **Service templates**: Maintain a library of default service definitions
- **Git integration**: Use git to restore previous versions

### 2. Service Dependencies

Add dependency checking to prevent disabling services that other services depend on:

```go
// Define service dependencies
var serviceDeps = map[string][]string{
    "drupal": {"mariadb", "solr"},
    "matomo": {"mariadb"},
}

// Check before disabling
func (sm *ServiceManager) CheckDependencies(serviceName string) error
```

### 3. Preset Configurations

Allow users to apply preset configurations:

```bash
sitectl create context mysite --preset=minimal
sitectl service apply-preset minimal
```

Presets could be defined as:
```yaml
presets:
  minimal:
    disable: [blazegraph, fedora, fits]
  development:
    disable: [matomo]
  production:
    disable: [ide]
```

### 4. Interactive Service Selection

During `create context`, prompt user to select which services to include:

```
Which optional services would you like to include?
[x] Blazegraph (triplestore)
[x] Fedora (repository)
[ ] FITS (file characterization)
[x] Matomo (analytics)
```

### 5. Service Status Checking

Add ability to check if disabled services have running containers:

```bash
sitectl service status blazegraph
# Output: Service 'blazegraph' is disabled in docker-compose.yml but has running containers
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test service disable on local context**:
   ```bash
   sitectl create context test --type local --profile dev --project-dir /tmp/test
   sitectl service list --context test
   sitectl service disable blazegraph --context test
   sitectl compose down --context test
   sitectl compose up --context test
   ```

2. **Test service disable during creation**:
   ```bash
   sitectl create context test2 \
     --type local \
     --project-dir /tmp/test2 \
     --disable-service=blazegraph \
     --yes
   ```

3. **Test with remote context**: Same commands with `--type remote` and SSH flags

### Unit Tests

Key test cases needed:

- `TestReadComposeFile`: Test parsing docker-compose.yml
- `TestDisableService`: Test service removal
- `TestCleanupOrphanedVolumes`: Test volume cleanup logic
- `TestListServices`: Test service listing
- `TestServiceExists`: Test service existence checking

Example test structure:
```go
func TestDisableService(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name        string
        service     string
        wantErr     bool
        checkVolume string
        volumeGone  bool
    }{
        {"disable blazegraph", "blazegraph", false, "blazegraph-data", true},
        {"disable nonexistent", "fake", true, "", false},
    }
    // ... test implementation
}
```

## Conclusion

## Deploy Job TODO

This should be a separate PR from the current job/cron work.

### Goals

- Add a first-class deploy job to the sitectl job system.
- Keep deploy logic in Go rather than encoding it as a shell blob.
- Use the **currently checked out branch** in the target project checkout rather than a separate `origin/$GIT_BRANCH` input.
- Support plugin-defined deploy hooks for setup, update, and post-update actions.
- Add a way to duplicate an existing context onto a specific branch so deploy targets can be staged safely.

### High-Level Deploy Flow

```text
if lock file exists: exit

create lock file
cd context.ProjectDir

resolve current checked out branch
git fetch origin
git reset --hard
git reset --hard origin/<current-branch>

docker compose pull

plugin pre-deploy hook
  example: put Drupal into maintenance mode

docker compose up \
  --remove-orphans \
  --wait \
  --pull missing \
  --quiet-pull \
  -d

plugin update hook
  example: drush updb -y || log and continue according to policy

docker compose up \
  --remove-orphans \
  --wait \
  --pull missing \
  --quiet-pull \
  -d

remove lock file

plugin post-deploy hook
  example: maintenance mode off, cache clear, notification
```

### Job SDK Requirements

The sitectl SDK should expose job-oriented primitives for plugin authors:

- Run host commands in `context.ProjectDir`
- Run commands in a named compose service/container
- Run docker compose operations with context-aware compose/env flags
- Copy artifacts to/from containers and hosts
- Read and write files through local/remote contexts
- Create and clean up lock files
- Emit structured step logs
- Support best-effort steps where failure can be logged and tolerated

### Plugin Hook Model

Deploy should be generic in core and specialized in plugins:

- **Core deploy job**:
  - lock handling
  - git fetch/reset to current branch
  - docker compose pull/up orchestration
  - failure handling and cleanup
- **Plugin hooks**:
  - pre-deploy
  - update
  - post-deploy

Examples:

- Drupal pre-deploy:
  - `drush state:set system.maintenance_mode 1 --input-format=integer`
- Drupal update:
  - `drush updb -y`
- Drupal post-deploy:
  - maintenance mode off
  - cache rebuild
  - notify

### Context Duplication on Branch

Need a command to duplicate an existing context to a new context that tracks a specific branch.

Possible shape:

```bash
sitectl config duplicate-context existing-context new-context \
  --branch feature/my-branch \
  --project-dir /path/to/another/checkout
```

Requirements:

- Start from an existing saved context definition
- Override at least:
  - context name
  - project dir
  - possibly environment
- Validate the new checkout exists
- Check out the requested branch in that checkout
- Save as a new context without mutating the source context

### Open Questions

- Should the deploy lock file live in `context.ProjectDir`, `/tmp`, or a dedicated sitectl runtime dir?
- Should plugin update hooks fail the deploy, or be configurable as best-effort?
- Should notifications be plugin hooks, generic job steps, or both?
- Should deploy support local-only initially, with remote execution reusing existing context SSH support?
- Should deploy be a job (`sitectl job run deploy`) or a dedicated top-level command that is also expressible as a job?
